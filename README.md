This is crap code. Let's get that out of the way.

In 1999, I wrote a quick 3D demo using OpenGL for class over a period of a couple
of weeks. It was originally written with Borland C++ Builder, which I soon
converted to VC6. Since then, I pull it up once every couple of years and tinker
with it for a few hours. Currently, it's VC2010, with some C++11 constructs.

The general goal with this code is to refactor it into something sane, and perhaps
pull out some of the more general code into libraries. The general engine code I
think could be merged with a couple of other engines I have. x64, iPhone, Raspberry
Pi, and DirectX support could be added, along with some proper collision handling,
deferred lighting, GPU particles, etc.  Most of this should be pretty easy.

The code in _3DDemo_ is a mess, but the code in other folders isn't too bad. I'm
uploading it to GitHub to force myself to add keep a commit streak going. Again,
I apologize in advance.
